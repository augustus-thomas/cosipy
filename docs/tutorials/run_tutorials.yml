# Local paths are relative to where this file lives
# Wasabi paths are relative to the wasabi bucket
# The notebook can be either a specific path, or a list. The latter will
# run all in the list in series.
# Each tutorial entry is run independently from each other.
# The notebook and the ancillary files are copied to the output directory
# The notebook, by default, should use paths relative to the notebook

tutorials:
  globals:
    output_dir: # Will append tutorial name to each tutorial. Not optional, it needs to be provided either here or on the command line
    wasabi_bucket: cosi-pipeline-public
    wasabi_mirror:  # Optional. Mirror of bucket above
    kernel: python3 # Optional but recommended
    timeout:  # in seconds, per cell. Optional

    # Tutorial names are arbitrary, but can be used to specify
